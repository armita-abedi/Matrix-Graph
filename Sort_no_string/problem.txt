You have an array of 10 items. Each item in the array is a word greater than 4 characters long. Without using any built-in array structures, string functions, or sorting algorithms, you will need to restructure the array in the follow ways:

Order the array alphabetically. Take the alphabetically ordered array, and reverse each string. Take the alphabetically ordered array, and order each string alphabetically. (i.e., apple -> aelpp)

Input Format: Problem should receive a string of at least 10, single-word items greater than 4 characters, separated by commas.

Constraints: You are not allowed to use built-in array structures. You are not allowed to use any built-in string/character functions. You are not allowed to use any built-in sorting methods.

Output Format: You should return three strings of items, separated by commas. The first string should be an alphabatized list of the items from the input string. The second string should be the first string with each item's characters reversed. The third string should be the first string with each item's characters in alphabetical order.
